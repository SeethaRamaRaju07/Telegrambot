Create an AWS Lambda function:
Go to the AWS Lambda console.
Click on the "Create function" button.
Select "Author from scratch".
Give your function a name and select the programming language you want to use.
For this example, we will be using Node.js.
Click on "Create function".
2. Write the Lambda function code:
In the "Function code" section, paste the following code:
exports.handler = async (event) => {
 const response = {
  statusCode: 200,
  body: JSON.stringify('Hello from Lambda!'),
 };
 return response;
};
This code simply returns a JSON object with the message "Hello from Lambda!".
2. Test the Lambda function:
Click on the "Test" button.
Enter a name for the test event and click on "Create".
Click on the "Test" button again.
You should see the response with the message "Hello from Lambda!".
Create an AWS API Gateway:
Go to the AWS API Gateway console.
Click on "Create API".
Select "REST API".
Give your API a name and click on "Create API".
3. Create a resource and method:
Click on "Create Resource".
Give your resource a name and click on "Create Resource".
Click on "Create Method" and select "GET".
Select "Lambda Function" as the integration type.
Select the region where your Lambda function is located.
Select the name of your Lambda function and click on "Save".
4. Deploy your API:
Click on "Actions" and select "Deploy API".
Select the deployment stage you want to use (e.g. "prod") and click on "Deploy".
5.Test your API:
In the "Invoke URL" section, you should see the URL of your API.
Open a new tab in your browser and enter the URL.
You should see the response with the message "Hello from Lambda!".
Congratulations, you have created a bot using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda! This is just a simple example, but you can use this as a starting point to create more complex bots.
